# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented in Java and stored in a folder named after the problem.

## Repository Structure

- All problems (Easy, Medium, and Hard) are stored together.
- Each problem has its own folder named after the problem, e.g., `Two_Sum`.
- Inside each problem folder, there is a `.java` file containing the solution. The `.java` file includes:
  - **Code Solution**: The logic to solve the problem.
  - **Note**: The code may not include a driver code or test cases; it focuses solely on the solution logic.

### Example Structure:

LeetCode-Solution/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Two_Sum/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Solution.java
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Add_Two_Numbers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Solution.java
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ Longest_Palindromic_Substring/
    â””â”€â”€ Solution.java


## How to Use

- **Find a Problem**: Browse through the folders to find a specific problem using its name or number.
- **View the Solution**: Open the `.java` file in the corresponding folder to view the solution.
- **Run the Code**: Copy the solution code into your preferred IDE or coding platform (such as LeetCode itself) to test and run it.

## Notes

- These solutions are optimized to pass all test cases on LeetCode.
- The code focuses on solving the problem logic and may not include a main method or driver code, as LeetCode provides its own driver code for testing.
- Some solutions might have additional comments to explain the logic and thought process behind the approach.
